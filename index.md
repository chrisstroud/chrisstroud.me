# [Hi, I'm Chris](https://christroud.me)

I love working at early-stage startups. Thatâ€™s my jam.

Currently, I am the Principal, Data & AI at [Flaunt](https://www.flauntloyalty.com/). Previously, I was Director of Business Operations at [Xola](https://xola.com/), where I spent 9 years leading Data Analytic & BizOps. I reported directly to the CEO and collaborated cross-functionally across Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Product, and Engineering.

I am currently working full-time but remain open to consulting opportunities. You can reach me at [chris.ryan.stroud@gmail.com](mailto:chris.ryan.stroud@gmail.com) or (510) 825-0165.
