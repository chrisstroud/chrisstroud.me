# [Hi, I'm Chris](https://christroud.me)

I love working at early-stage startups. That’s my jam.

Most recently, I was Director of Business Operations at [Xola](https://xola.com/) (B2B Vertical SaaS, 75+ people, $10M+ ARR), where I spent 7 years leading BizOps, RevOps, and Analytics. I reported directly to the CEO and worked cross-functionally across Sales, Marketing, CS, Product, and Engineering to help the company scale.

I’m currently open to new full-time roles — in-person/hybrid or remote in the San Francisco Bay Area. You can reach me at [chris.ryan.stroud@gmail.com](mailto:chris.ryan.stroud@gmail.com) or (510) 825-0165.
