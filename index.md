# [Hi, I'm Chris](https://christroud.me)

I love working at early-stage startups. That's my jam.

Most recently, I was the Director of Business Operations @ [Xola](https://www.xola.com) (B2B Vertical SaaS, 100+ people, 15M+ ARR), where I wore a lot of hats — leading BizOps, RevOps, and Analytics, reporting directly to the CEO for 7 years, and working cross-functionally with teams across Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Engineering, and Product. 

**I'm currently looking for a new full-time role** — remote or hybrid/in-person in the San Francisco Bay Area. Feel free to get in touch at chris.ryan.stroud@gmail.com, (510) 825-0165, or schedule a time to chat using the widget in the bottom-right-hand corner.
